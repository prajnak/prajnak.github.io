                    <p>Hi, I'm Prajna Kandarpa, usually go by Praj, and this is my landing page.
                        I graduated with a major in Mechatronics Engineering at the <a href="http://mme.uwaterloo.ca" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> in May 2016. I also worked during and after my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/people-profiles/prajna-kandarpa" target = "_blank">UW's Embedded Software Group</a>. </p>
              </div> -->
              <div>
                <h2>professional summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Software engineering leader with deep knowledge of modern software systems with fully automated build and release processes, full stack and machine learning engineer recruitment, mentoring and retainment strategies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hired, mentored, retained and led engineering teams (full-stack, machine learning and quality assurance) of sizes 4-22 people in consumer and enterprise software product companies with multiple thousand (lakhs) active users. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cares deeply about the professional and personal growth of my team members, and implement regular 1:1s, monthly meets 
                    with interactive surveys, quizzes and fun events. From a software development perspective, I help create standardised processes for a product’s Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by working closely with stakeholders in engineering and product teams.
                </p>
                <h3>people management</h3>
                <p>
                    From an employee and people management purview, collected anonymised feedback on many aspects of each employee’s experience, gather group trends 
                    in feedback, share them publicly and use the insights to drive process changes, identify bottlenecks and resolve technical/personal and other 
                    challenges faced by engineering teams.
                </p>
                <h3>software development lifecycle</h3>
                <p>
                    Deep knowledge of setting up essential SDLC infrastructural elements like CI/CD systems, Code health scanning, code and container security 
                    scanning, unit test coverage checks, automated integration tests and more. I regularly review code being written by the team, help setup and 
                    determine architectural design specifications through collaborative reviews with tech leads and engineering managers. 
                </p>
                <h3>software security</h3>
                <p>
                    Made significant contributions to setting up processes around application security, container security assessment of software products using third party security vendors, 
                    CI/CD based security scans, and regular reviews + remediation strategies. </p>
                <h3>organisational impact</h3>
                <p>
                    Align with organisational and business goals and drive engineering teams to deliver successful products and projects that involve 
                    standard full stack components (web apps, mobile apps, distributed backend), all deployed in a cloud native manner with error traceability and 
                    observability built in from day one. 
                    
                    <b>Products built by engineering teams I’ve led have earned their respective organisations revenue to the tune of $30m+ in the past 5 years.</b>
